            Additional checks for this FTC skills marketplace repository:
            - If files in plugins/ are added/modified, verify README.md skill table is updated
            - If .claude-plugin/marketplace.json is modified, verify README.md matches
            - For new skills: check SKILL.md has proper frontmatter (name, description with WHAT and WHEN triggers)
            - Verify plugin.json name matches the folder name
            - Check that new skills are added to marketplace.json
            - If SKILL.md shows `uv run scripts/*.py`, check if the script only uses Python stdlib (sys, math, json, etc.)
              - If script has NO external dependencies (no numpy, requests, pandas, etc.), suggest using `python scripts/*.py` instead
              - Rationale: Simpler and more accessible - all systems have Python, not everyone has uv installed
              - uv should only be recommended when scripts actually need external packages
