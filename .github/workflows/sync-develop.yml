          The automatic sync from main to develop failed due to merge conflicts.

          **Main commit:** ${main_short} (${main_commit})

          ### Manual Resolution Required

          1. Checkout the develop branch and merge main manually
          2. Resolve any conflicts
          3. Push the resolved changes

          ### Why This Happened

          This usually occurs when hotfixes were committed directly to main or multiple release PRs were merged in quick succession.

          ### Prevention

          Always merge changes through develop first and use the release process for all version bumps.
