## Merge Conflict Detected

The automatic sync from `main` to `develop` failed due to merge conflicts.

**Main commit:** `MAIN_SHORT_PLACEHOLDER` (MAIN_COMMIT_PLACEHOLDER)

### Manual Resolution Required

1. Checkout the develop branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. Merge main into develop:
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   ```

3. Resolve any conflicts manually

4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git commit
   git push origin develop
   ```

### Why This Happened

This usually occurs when:
- Hotfixes were committed directly to main (bypassing develop)
- Multiple release PRs were merged in quick succession
- Manual edits were made to main outside the release process

### Prevention

- Always merge changes through develop first
- Use the release process for all version bumps
- Avoid direct commits to main
